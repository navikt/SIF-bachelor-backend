### How to prepare the project for the dockerfile:
**The compose is depended on a frontend image, please remeber to create a frontend image!**

The dockerfile looks after jar file in the target folder. **This is created in the dockerfile**, so to compile your own jar file should not be nessitary

if you need to create a manual jar file you can use these two commands. 

```bash
./mvnw compile
```
and then:  
```bash 
./mvnw package -Dmaven.test.skip
```


After this, the dockerfile is ready to use

To run the docker Compose file you can do

Docker Compose up
